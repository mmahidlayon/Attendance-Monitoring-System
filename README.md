# Attendance Monitoring System
A web-based application system designed for our Aikido dojo, Sacred Heart Aikido Center Cebu.

In our dojo, students (aikidoka) are required to complete a specific number of training sessions before they can take promotion exams (e.g., 45 sessions for 6th to 5th kyu, 60 sessions for 5th to 4th kyu, etc.). This system provides a convenient way for:  
- **Students** – to log and track their own attendance progress toward the next rank.  
- **Admin** (Sensei or Senpai) – to monitor attendance of all students

The goal of this project is both practical (helping our dojo) and educational (serving as a learning project for web development using Python, Flask, MySQL, and Bootstrap).
